# The data

All data is **imported, not authored**. It is fetched, parsed and written out
by the notebook; nothing is typed in by hand and nothing is invented to fill a
gap. Where a source says nothing, so does OffSpawn — a missing earnings figure
renders as a dash, never a zero.

There is one dataset, and every game reads it:
`liquipedia_data/clean_data/fortnite/` — 5,678 players, 14,645 tournaments,
442,736 placements, from [Liquipedia (Fortnite)](https://liquipedia.net/fortnite/).

Everything is Liquipedia's, FNCS title counts included: they are counted from
Liquipedia's own results, like every other number.

Licensing is in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) and
[src/data/LICENSE.md](src/data/LICENSE.md) — the data is CC BY-SA 3.0, not AGPL like the code.

```bash
npm run check:games   # play all ten games headlessly
```

The derived files are committed, so the site builds with no network access.
`scripts/build_data.py` produces all of them from the raw dump.

## Keeping the dump current

The commands, step by step: [UPDATE_DATA.md](UPDATE_DATA.md). How it works:

`scripts/liquipedia_api.py` brings the **raw** dump up to date from the
LiquipediaDB API: `liquipedia_data/raw_data/fortnite/` (git-ignored), the five
files the cleaning notebooks read. You run it; nothing else does.

- **60 requests an hour.** Every request is logged in `sync_state.json`, so a
  run waits rather than overruns, even straight after another. A 429 waits for
  `Retry-After`, or an hour. Ctrl+C is safe; the next run carries on.
- **Only what changed.** Players and teams are re-read whole (about 8
  requests). Tournaments, transfers and placements are read from the last sync
  minus 30 days, and that window replaces what we held for it. A normal run is
  15–20 requests.
- **Older edits come by webhook.** Give Liquipedia
  `https://<site>/api/liquipedia/<LIQUIPEDIA_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`. The server keeps
  the pings; with `OFFSPAWN_URL` and `OFFSPAWN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set, the script
  reads them and re-reads those pages. Deleted pages lose their rows.
- **It will not overwrite a file with a broken answer**: a window or a table
  that comes back smaller than what it would delete is refused.

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/liquipedia_api.py --since 2026-09-14   # the first time
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/check_liquipedia_api.py                # its checks, against a fake API
```

**Subscribers and followers** come from the platforms, not Liquipedia:
`scripts/socials_api.py` reads the YouTube and Twitch links on each player's
page in the raw dump and writes `clean_data/fortnite/socials.json` — page name
to subscriber count, and to follower count, the bigger channel when a page
links two. A channel that hides its count, or a link that leads nowhere, is
left out. It remembers every link's channel ID in `raw_data/fortnite/socials_state.json`,
so YouTube's first run costs 1,500–1,900 of the free 10,000 daily units and
every run after it about 70; Twitch logs in once with a code (the token lives
in `~/.offspawn/`, outside the repo). `scripts/check_socials_api.py` tests it
against fake APIs. The file is never committed: YouTube keeps its numbers
fresh for 30 days and Twitch for 24 hours, which old git history cannot do.
The live server fetches its own copy daily from the links in `links.json`
(`scripts/pipeline/site.py` writes it from the raw dump; `server/socials.ts`
fetches) and serves only fresh counts at `/api/socials` (decided 3 Oct 2026). This
local file is what a dev server and `check:games` use. Setup: [UPDATE_DATA.md](UPDATE_DATA.md).

Then `scripts/build_data.py` turns the raw dump into every file the site
reads, in three steps, each in `scripts/pipeline/`:

| step | does | was |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clean.py` | raw -> clean players, teams, tournaments, transfers, placements | the five cleaning notebooks |
| `enrich.py` | FNCS titles, `tier`, `region_tier`, `orgs.json`, `bios.json` | `players_optimize.ipynb` (deleted) |
| `derived.py` | rankings, pools, teammates, career path, facts | the cells of `notebook_cells.md` (deleted) |

- **It builds in a staging folder**, runs `npm run check:games` on the result,
  and only then replaces the files - all together, so a failed step leaves the
  site's data as it was. It also sets `EXPORT_DATE` in `roster.ts`.
- **FNCS titles**: every player on the 1st-placed team of every regional FNCS
  grand final, from Liquipedia's own results — PC only, the 2020 console FNCS
  is not counted. The build reports a final with no winner yet (an upcoming one)
  and any winner it cannot match to a player page.
- **Proved against the notebooks**: on the same raw dump the five clean files
  come out identical to the notebooks' output, and on the current clean files
  `enrich.py` and `derived.py` reproduce `players.json`, `orgs.json` and every
  derived file exactly.

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/liquipedia_api.py   # what changed on Liquipedia
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/build_data.py       # every data file, checked
```

`--from players` or `--from derived` starts later, reusing the clean files;
`--out DIR` builds somewhere else to compare first.

## The Liquipedia roster

Every game runs on this dataset, in `liquipedia_data/clean_data/fortnite/`,
read **in place**. There is no build step and no derived copy — regenerate a
file and reload.

| file | holds | read through |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roster.json` | the players the games use — `players.json`'s columns that are read, with empty values left out (`scripts/pipeline/site.py`) | `Roster` |
| `players.json` | 5,678 playable rows in full: handle, aliases, country, birthday, earnings, status; `Roster` falls back to it when `roster.json` is missing | the pipeline |
| `career_path.json` | 187 majors and every player's finishes in them (1,175 with five or more) | `Majors` |
| `teammates.json` | each player's fifty most-played-with teammates | `Teammates` |
| `orgs.json` | 984 organisations, with who has ever played for them and, for those with a team page, when they were founded and disbanded | `Orgs` |
| `bios.json` | real names (~2,000 players) and every spell at an organisation with the day it started and ended (~14,500 stints), from `transfers.json` | `Bios` — IRL, Org Chart, Transfer Window, Rewind; without it they fall back to `players.json`'s names and `orgs.json`'s undated lists |
| `facts.json` | per player: tournaments played, LAN and FNCS appearances, wins by kind, where and when they won, which headline events they played | `Facts` |
| `rankings.json` | ~290 precomputed top-tens, answered in players, orgs, countries or tournaments | `Rankings` |
| `pools.json` | the qualified field for one event — Globals 2026, EWC 2026 | `Pools` |

All but `players.json`, `orgs.json` and `bios.json` are **derived** from `tournaments.json` and
`placements.json` by `scripts/pipeline/derived.py`; those two come from
`transfers.json` and `teams.json` in `scripts/pipeline/enrich.py`. In both
`orgs.json` and `bios.json` an organisation's name is matched loosely — "NRG
Esports" is NRG and "Falcons Esports" Team Falcons — because transfers spell an
org the way it was named on the day (`org_resolver(loose=True)`). `orgs.json`
matched display names exactly until 3 Oct 2026, so "has played for NRG" missed
the six players who joined and left as NRG Esports (12 then, 18 now). None carries a `tier`: difficulty is
joined from `players.json` by page name, so there is still exactly one place
difficulty is decided.

`rankings.json` is precomputed rather than derived at runtime because its
source is 442,736 placement rows across 154 MB, which is not something a phone
should aggregate per page load. The boards only change when the export does.

A file that has not been generated is simply **absent**, and that is a
supported state. `src/data/liquipedia/files.ts` reads the folder with
`import.meta.glob`, so a missing file is a value to branch on rather than a
build failure — the games that need it show their "has it been generated?"
banner and the rest carry on. `npm run check:games` reports them as SKIPPED and
still passes.

These columns of `players.json` are maintained upstream, by the notebook that
owns the data:

| column | values | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tier` | `easy` / `medium` / `hard` / `unused` | difficulty band; `unused` rows are dropped when the roster loads and never reach a game |
| `region_tier` | same, optional | difficulty band within `region`, for Fortnitedle's region picker |
| `fncs_wins` | integer ≥ 0 | regional FNCS grand finals won (PC), counted from Liquipedia's results |

`tier` is opaque to the app. Nothing recomputes it and there is no fallback
ranking, so changing how it is calculated changes every game at once and
requires no code change. `region_tier` is read in its place only when a region
has been chosen, and falls back to `tier` when the column is absent.

### Why region needs its own column

`tier` ranks all 5,678 rows against each other. Split by region, the Easy band
is almost entirely NA and EU:

| region | easy | medium | hard |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| North America | 53 | 344 | 1403 |
| Europe | 57 | 355 | 1208 |
| Asia | **0** | 82 | 566 |
| Oceania | **0** | 72 | 544 |
| South America | 3 | 104 | 351 |
| Middle East | **0** | 51 | 370 |
| Africa | 0 | 1 | 21 |

So "Asia + Easy" on the global band is not a thin pool, it is an empty one,
and the tier widening would hand back Medium without saying so. Ranked inside
the region the same 2% / 18% / 80% cut gives Asia 13 / 118 / 526 and every
region but Africa all three bands. Africa has 22 rows, so 2% rounds to nobody;
the setup screen greys that card out with its count showing rather than
widening behind your back.

### One source

Every game reads the Liquipedia export: 5,678 players, their finishes at 187
majors and who they queued with across all 14,645 tournaments, read directly
through `Roster`, `Majors`, `Teammates` and the rest. There is no second source:
the FNCS count is read off the regional finals' results like everything else.

### Inputs

Read-only, and untouched by the build:

```
liquipedia_data/clean_data/fortnite/
  players.json       5,726 pages — handle, real name, nationalities, region,
                     birthdate, career and per-year earnings, current team
  teams.json         535 organisations
  tournaments.json   14,645 tournaments with Liquipedia tier and prize pool
  placements.json    442,736 finishes
  transfers.json     40,119 roster moves (not used yet)
```

`liquipedia_data/` is gitignored **except** the seven files the site reads —
`players`, `career_path`, `teammates`, `orgs`, `facts`, `rankings` and `pools`,
about 6 MB together — because a deploy builds from the repo and a clone
without them has no games. `placements.json` at 154 MB, `tournaments.json`,
`transfers.json` and `teams.json` stay ignored.

Until 24 Sep 2026 this paragraph said `players.json` was already committed.
It never was: `.gitignore` excluded the whole folder and then tried to
re-include single files with `!` lines, which git does not allow inside an
excluded folder. The rules now open each folder level in turn.

### What the notebook derives from `placements.json`

**Career Path** takes the tournaments the notebook calls majors — currently
Liquipedia tier 1, no tier type, organised by Epic Games, from the 2019 World
Cup on, minus the console / mobile / Twitch brackets and challenge events
(MrBeast's): 187 of them. The file carries every player with one (cell 7 in
`scripts/pipeline/derived.py`), but a player needs five to be a possible answer on the
whole roster, which leaves 1,175 — 92 Easy, 567 Medium, 516 Hard. An event
field asks about anyone in it with one, and a short career gets five guesses. Rows with no numeric placement (`''`,
`DNP`, `DQ` — 352 of them) are dropped; a range like `35-36` reads as 35.

**Who Are Ya** counts a pair once per placement row they share, which is what
"played together" means — 213,666 of the 442,736 rows are a roster of two or
more, and two solo players at the same event are not teammates. That gives
39,038 distinct pairs and counts with weight behind them: Peterbot and Pollo
have entered 126 tournaments together, not just the ones they won.

61,016 participant names (205,641 rows) have no `players.json` page and are
skipped, because there is nothing to render and nothing to guess. A count is
therefore "tournaments together that Liquipedia can name us both in", not an
absolute.

### What the build does

1. Keeps pages with a competitive record (some prize money). Liquipedia files
   the scene's streamers as `staff`, but Nate Hill, SypherPK, Myth and CouRage
   have all won real money and are more recognisable than most tier-1
   competitors, so `type` is not filtered on. Players recorded as having died
   are left out — the game asks how old someone is *today*.
2. Maps nationalities to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 for the flag badge; all 121 values
   in the dump are covered, and the build reports any that are not.
3. Resolves handles to pages. 142 handles belong to two or more pages ("Aqua"
   is both the Austrian World Cup winner and a Japanese player); nationality
   settles it where the caller knows one, otherwise the biggest career wins.
4. Scores every 1st place by Liquipedia's tier, tier type and prize pool, and
   derives the fame ranking from that plus career earnings.
5. Counts **FNCS titles** from Liquipedia's results: every player on the
   1st-placed team of every regional grand final, by the page the result links
   to, so namesakes cannot swap titles. PC finals only. The code is
   `fncs_titles` in `scripts/pipeline/enrich.py`.

### The FNCS Wins category

The count is Liquipedia's regional grand finals, winner by winner (see above),
so a player who never won one reads as 0.

247 players hold at least one (422 titles), and 159 of them hold exactly one,
so among the title-holders ties are common:

| Tier | Players with a title | Chance a random pair of them ties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | 58 | ~27% |
| Medium | 169 | ~49% |
| Hard | 20, all on one | 100% |

On Easy and Medium there is no Equal button, so a tie accepts either answer.
That makes Medium generous. If you would rather it were a real question, give
the category its own Equal rule in `hasEqualButton()`:

```ts
export function hasEqualButton(difficulty: Difficulty, category?: Category): boolean {
  return difficulty === 'hard' || category === 'fncsWins';
}
```

Hard's twenty title-holders all have exactly one.

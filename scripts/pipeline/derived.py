The files the games read that are derived from the clean ones: rankings.json,
pools.json, teammates.json, career_path.json and facts.json.

These were the cells of notebook_cells.md - 1 to 7, then the facts.json
appendix - copied in verbatim and run top to bottom in one function, so every
cell sees what the ones before it defined, exactly as in one notebook kernel.
This file is where a derivation changes now. notebook_cells.md, with the longer
write-up of each cell, was deleted on 27 Sep 2026; git history has it.

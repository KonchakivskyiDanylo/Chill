/**
 * What the site records, and in what shape.
 *
 * One record per *finished round* — never per click, never per page view. The
 * site had no telemetry at all before this, and the reason to add some is
 * narrow: to see which games and boards people play and where the puzzles are
 * too hard or too easy. Everything below is chosen for that and nothing else.
 *
 * Nothing identifies a person. There is no device id, no account, no cookie
 * for players (the only cookie is the admin login on `/analytics`), and the
 * server does not keep IP addresses. Totals are global: "Tenaball was played
 * 300 times", never "this device played 30 of them".
 *
 * Shared by the browser (which sends records), the server (which stores
 * them) and `aggregate.ts` (which turns them into the dashboard), so the three
 * cannot disagree about a field.

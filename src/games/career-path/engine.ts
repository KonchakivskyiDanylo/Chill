 * How the ten clues are chosen.
 *
 * The old picker had one idea — the best result from each stretch of the
 * career — and it produced exactly the rounds nobody enjoys: a champion's path
 * read 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, 1st, which says "a winner" and nothing else; the
 * first clue for Bugha was the World Cup, which ends the round before it has
 * started; and a duo that played every major side by side got a clue list
 * that described both of them, so the right answer could be either.
 *
 * Now each clue is picked one at a time, scoring every result still unused on
 * what it would add to the list:
 *
 *   event    how recognisable the stage is — a Globals or the World Cup over a
 *            $65k regional final, on the prize pool's log scale
 *   mix      a finish band the list does not have yet (win, podium, top 10,
 *            top 25, the rest), and a penalty for a placement it already has
 *   spread   distance in time from the clues already picked, so the list
 *            covers the career rather than its best year — heavy in Order,
 *            where the career is read as a story, light in Random
 *   unique   whether it rules out someone else the list still describes — a
 *            duo partner, until one result they did not share is in
 *
 * plus a little noise, so meeting the same player twice is not the same round.
 *
 * Two rules sit on top. The list must describe exactly one player: if the
 * picks still fit someone else, the weakest is swapped for a result that
 * player does not share. The only careers where that cannot be done are the
 * thirteen whose every major was played beside the same partner — there the
 * partner fits every clue, and naming them first costs one clue.
 *
 * And the opening must not give the answer away: a signature result — any
 * major win, or a podium on a $1M stage — never comes in the first few
 * clues, how many depending on how famous the player is.
 * Three for the household names, two for the regulars, none for the deep
 * cuts, whose biggest stage is the only thing anyone could know them by. The
 * weights lean the same way: famous players get more mix, obscure players
 * more big events.

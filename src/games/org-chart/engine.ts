 *

 * clue styles; for V2 ("more clue types, revealed progressively — think about
 * something") the org's own facts are dealt in between the players: its region
 * after the third, the year it was founded after the fifth, its prize money
 * last. The facts only ever narrow a field the players have already pointed at.

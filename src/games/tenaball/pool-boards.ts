/**
 * Tenaball boards for one tournament's field.
 *
 * The shipped boards in `rankings.json` are all-time and precomputed, for the
 * good reason given in `rankings.ts`: they are aggregated from 442,736
 * placement rows, which is not a thing to ask a phone to do. An event field is
 * the opposite problem — eighty to a hundred players, every number already on
 * the roster row or in `facts.json` — so these are derived here, on the spot.
 *
 * That matters beyond saving a notebook run: the mode is a lens, and a lens
 * that only worked on eight of the ten games would be a worse feature than no
 * lens at all. "Top 10 of the Globals field by earnings" is a better Tenaball
 * board than most of the two hundred shipped ones, because you can picture the
 * whole answer set before you start typing.
 *
 * The result is wrapped in a `Rankings`, so the game itself cannot tell the
 * difference between these and the shipped set.
 */

/**
 * Every board this field can fill, in the order they are offered.
 *
 * Deliberately boards that read as questions — "who earned the most", "who is
 * the youngest" — rather than everything the columns permit.
 *
 * One heading and a fixed order. These were filed under Players, Countries and
 * Organisations like the shipped boards, which scattered a field's dozen
 * boards across three headings in no particular order; a field is one subject.
 * The order is the one planned for an event's fortnight in LIMITED_MODE.md,
 * where the boards that need the event's own results — the top ten of day
 * one, eliminations, upsets — are listed too. Those wait for the data.

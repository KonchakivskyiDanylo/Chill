/**
 * Tenaball boards for one tournament's field.
 *
 * The shipped boards in `rankings.json` are all-time and precomputed, for the
 * good reason given in `rankings.ts`: they are aggregated from 442,736
 * placement rows, which is not a thing to ask a phone to do. An event field is
 * the opposite problem — eighty to a hundred players, every number already on
 * the roster row or in `facts.json` — so these are derived here, on the spot.
 *
 * That matters beyond saving a notebook run: the mode is a lens, and a lens
 * that only worked on eight of the ten games would be a worse feature than no
 * lens at all. "Top 10 of the Globals field by earnings" is a better Tenaball
 * board than most of the two hundred shipped ones, because you can picture the
 * whole answer set before you start typing.
 *
 * The result is wrapped in a `Rankings`, so the game itself cannot tell the
 * difference between these and the shipped set.

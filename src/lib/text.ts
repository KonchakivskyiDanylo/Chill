/**
 * Name handling for every game that takes a typed player name.
 *
 * Players type fast, on phones, and from memory — so matching is deliberately
 * forgiving in three separate ways, each of which fixes a real failure:
 *
 *   case / spacing / accents   `th0mas hd` finds Th0masHD
 *   alternate handles          `Shark` finds shxrk, who used to be Shark
 *   digits that read as letters `king` finds K1nG
 *   one or two typos           `shxrk` finds Shark, `peterbo` finds Peterbot
 *
 * The last one is bounded: a typo is only accepted when exactly one player is
 * that close, so a vague stub never silently resolves to the wrong person.
 */

/**
 * Cyrillic and Greek letters that look exactly like Latin ones.
 *
 * Three handles in the roster are spelled with them — `Drobbаn` carries a
 * Cyrillic а (U+0430), `Crystаal` two, `Dуfs` a Cyrillic у. Without this they
 * are silently *deleted* by the A-Z0-9 filter below, so Drobban becomes the
 * six-tile word DROBBN: a Fortnitedle puzzle nobody can type their way out of,
 * and a name no search will ever find. Folding them to their Latin twins fixes
 * both, and covers any future ones the source picks up.

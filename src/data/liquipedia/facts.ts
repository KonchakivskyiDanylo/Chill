/**
 * Career facts `players.json` cannot answer.

 * `facts.json` is written by `scripts/build_data.py` from `tournaments.json` and
 * `placements.json`, and read here in place through the `@data` alias — the
 * same contract as `players.json`: no build step, no derived copy.
 *
 * It exists because the criteria games were starved. Griefer, Tic Tac Toe and
 * Connections generated most of their rules from country and region alone,
 * which is exactly why a Griefer board about "competes in Brazil" was solvable
 * by reading the flags rather than knowing the players. Where a player *won*,
 * how many LANs they turned up to, which headline events they played — all of
 * it is in the export and none of it was reaching a game.
 *
 * Deliberately no `tier` column: difficulty joins from `players.json` by page
 * name, so re-tiering the roster re-tiers every game and this never goes stale.

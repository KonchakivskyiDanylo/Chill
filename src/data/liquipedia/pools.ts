/**
 * Event-scoped player pools.
 *
 * `pools.json` is written by the notebook from `placements.json` and read here
 * in place through the `@data` alias.
 *
 * A pool is a fixed list of players and nothing else. Pick one in any game and
 * you get those players only — no region, no difficulty, no active/retired
 * split, because a pool of eighty is already the narrowest the games can go and
 * cutting it further leaves nothing to ask about. That is the whole feature:
 * the week the Globals are on, every game is about the Globals field.
 *
 * Two to start — the FNCS 2026 Global Championship field and the Esports World
 * Cup field, which Liquipedia files as `Reload Elite Series 2026 -
 * Championship`. A third is one entry in the notebook's `WANTED` list and no
 * code change here.

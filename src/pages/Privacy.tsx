 * server keeps — and carries what YouTube's API terms ask of a site that shows
 * its data: that the site uses YouTube API Services, a link to YouTube's Terms
 * of Service and to Google's Privacy Policy, what is collected and stored, and

          When you finish a round, the site sends a short record of it: the game, the puzzle, how you set it up,
          your answers and whether you won. It is used to see which puzzles are too hard or too easy. Nothing in
          it says who you are: there is no account, no device id and no cookie, and IP addresses are not saved.

          If a page breaks, the site may send the error message and the page it happened on, so it can be

          only if you add them — your contact details and the round you just played. They are used only to
          answer you and to fix what you report.

          Some games show players’ YouTube subscriber and Twitch follower counts. OffSpawn gets them from the
          YouTube Data API (YouTube API Services) and the Twitch API: only the public totals of the channels
          linked from players’ Liquipedia pages. The site asks YouTube and Twitch for nothing about you. It
          keeps only the latest counts, refreshed every day, and never longer than YouTube and Twitch allow.
